# 🛡️ Governance — AegisPHP

## Purpose

This document defines how AegisPHP is governed, how decisions are made,
and how the project evolves over time.

AegisPHP is built with architectural discipline, security-first principles,
and long-term stability in mind. Governance ensures these principles are preserved.

Core Maintainers have final decision authority.

### 2. Module Maintainers
Responsible for:
- Specific packages (e.g., bulwark, sigil, ledger)

- Maintaining documentation
- Ensuring package stability

### 3. Contributors
Responsible for:
- Submitting pull requests
- Reporting issues
- Improving documentation
- Proposing enhancements

## Decision Making

### Architectural Decisions

Major architectural changes:
- Must be discussed publicly
- Should include technical rationale
- Must align with AegisPHP principles:
  - Security-first
  - Zero magic
  - Modular independence
  - Clean Architecture compatibility

Core Maintainers have final approval.

---

### Minor Changes

Bug fixes and non-breaking improvements:
- Reviewed by maintainers
- Merged after approval and passing CI

---

## Versioning Policy

AegisPHP follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**.

- MAJOR → Breaking changes
- MINOR → Backward-compatible features
- PATCH → Bug fixes and security updates

Breaking changes require clear migration documentation.

---

## Security Governance

Security is overseen by Core Maintainers.

Responsibilities:
- Reviewing vulnerability reports
- Coordinating patches
- Publishing advisories
- Ensuring responsible disclosure

Security decisions may override feature decisions when necessary.

---

## Roadmap Process

The roadmap is defined by:

- Core Maintainers
- Community feedback
- Security requirements
- Ecosystem maturity

Major roadmap updates are documented publicly.

---

## Conflict Resolution

If disagreements arise:

1. Technical discussion first
2. Written rationale from involved parties
3. Core Maintainer decision if consensus is not reached

All discussions must follow the Code of Conduct.

---

## Transparency

AegisPHP values transparency:

- Public discussions
- Clear release notes
- Documented architectural decisions
- Open issue tracking

---

## Evolution

As AegisPHP grows, governance may evolve toward:

- Advisory board model
- Foundation-backed structure
- Commercial support entity

Any governance changes will be publicly documented.

---

## Core Principle
